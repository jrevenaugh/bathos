Shiny app for basic topographic analysis

Using ETOPO bathymetry (reformatted), perform basic topography analyses, including:

1. Topographic profiles (great circle segments, can be multiple joined segments).
2. 3D surface plotting of rectangular areas (lat,long) using plotly.
3. Hypsometry of profiles and surfaces with full statistics.

In addition, the site selection page uses leaflet and includes earthquake epicenters, NUVEL 1
plate boundaries and Smithsonian Institution Global Volcano Program holocene-active volcanoes.

Contact me for additional information or for access to pre-processed ETOPO files.
